Useful Oracle DBA Scripts

These sqlplus scripts are for Oracle Database performance optimization & troubleshooting and other DBA tasks. Most of the scripts should be runnable from sqlplus and SQLDeveloper (with the necessary access permissions).
These scripts I have found useful for various day to day tasks. You may use these scripts at your own risk, however you are strongly advised to cross reference with Oracle documentation.
